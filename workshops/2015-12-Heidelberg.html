<h1>Introduction to Multilevel Modeling with R</h1>
<p>The goal of this 2-day workshop is to offer participants a set of foundational insights into a category of models that has seen wide use in the past 2 decades in political science. Mixed-effects models are applicable to contexts where the sample is formed of observations (voters, students, political parties etc) clustered in groups (countries, schools). These models allow the researcher to test hypotheses related to observation-level phenomena using predictors at both the observation- and group-level. As such, mixed-effects models offer a more complex picture of social reality than competing strategies (e.g. OLS with group-level dummies), and of the links between individual attitudes or behaviors and contextual factors. The models have a wide applicability in the academic and private sector; they are used to analyze vote intentions, the effects of educational policies, the determinants of health outcomes, or in a variety of epidemiological studies.

Over these 2 days, we will cover the basic setup of a multilevel model in terms of notation, various indicators of model fit, some sample size considerations, as well as a host of smaller topics (estimation, the use of centering etc). Due to the limited amount of time available, the focus will be restricted to the case of continuous dependent variables, although at the end I will make a quick presentation of cases in which the dependent variable is binary. All analyses will be done with the help of the <tt>lme4</tt> package in R. I would encourage participants to keep a vigilant eye over the development of the <tt>Zelig</tt> package: while currently at version 5.0-9, it appears that with version 5.0-10 the package will again be able to handle hierarchical models.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data comes from wave 6 of the World Values Surveys, 2010-2014 (<a href="http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp</a>). With representative samples of citizens from about 60 countries from around the world, the WVS is a valuable source of information about social and political attitudes from a variety of societies. In my examples, I will only focus on a attitudinal scale constructed by the principal investigators of the project: an individual's placement on an obedience-emancipation continuum (see <a href="http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp?CMSID=welzelidx" target="_blank">http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp?CMSID=welzelidx</a>). I will try to predict an individual's placement on this scale using both individual-level and country-level factors.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Each of the days has an associated syntax file (with a ".R" extension). The file contains all instructions for 
installing needed R packages, reading data and producing statistical output. In addition to these, the file will 
contain comment on the code, which will appear after a hashtag symbol ("#"). The only thing participants will need 
to do is replace the working directory in the file to the folder address on their computer, and make sure that the 
folder structure is the same as mine. That will ensure that no further changes need to be made to the code to make 
it run on another machine, regardless of whether it is a UNIX or Windows-based system.</p>

<p>With regard to the folder structure, my practice has been to create a different folder for each day, e.g. 
"/Day-1/". In this folder I usually create 4 sub-folders: <b>Code</b> ("/Day-1/Code/"), <b>Data</b>, <b>Graphs</b>, 
and <b>Output</b>. The first two are where the syntax file and the data are deposited, while the last two are where 
graphs and statistical output (tables) are exported. Every syntax file below assumes that these same folders exist 
on your computer as well.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>Please download the materials found below, arranged based on session. The syntax and unpacked data files should 
be placed in their respective folders on your machine.</p>

<p> <b>Day 1 (December 16)</b>
<p>We focus today on basic theoretical concepts in survival analysis, and how to do descriptive summaries of
survival data in R.</p>

<p> <b>Day 2 (December 17)</b>
<p>Today we look at inferential survival analysis, using the Cox proportional hazards model, and a few extensions 
of it. The data for this session is linked below, as well as in the description above.</p>
