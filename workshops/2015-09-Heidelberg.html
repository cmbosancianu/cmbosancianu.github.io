<h1>Bayesian Analysis</h1>
<p>The 2-day workshop (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4FA18A6EE7842E5F!10188&authkey=!ABwp0MZ4p_8U-08&ithint=file%2cpdf">outline</a>) is intended as a basic introduction to the logic of Bayesian analysis and the practice of running regression analyses in the Bayesian framework. Due to the short time we have available, some mathematical depth will be sacrificed for the sake of gaining practical experience. To compensate for this, you can find in the outline of the class a set of readings which should cover in-depth some of the issues which I will only cover in very general terms (the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the Gibbs sampler etc). In the practical part of the class, we will be focusing on using the Bayesian framework to estimate a simple OLS model. The emphasis will be on how prior information about parameters influence the estimation results, how to check for model convergence, and how to verify that the model fits the data well.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Speaking of data, we will be using 2 sources throughout the workshop. The first comes from a current project I'm engaged in, trying to predict the determinants of welfare state generosity: how much a country spends on unemployment insurance, sickness and pension benefits, as well as what the rules governing access to this money are. The focus will be on seeing whether political factors (party platforms) have any influence on welfare generosity, when controlling for all other economic factors. For each of the 18 OECD countries in my sample I have only kept every fifth year in my final sample: 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001. This will constitute the data on which my examples will be based.</p>

<p>The second data source is mainly for you to experiment on, and it comes from the Cioffi-Revilla and Lai (2001) study of warfare in Ancient China (2700 B.C. to 722 B.C.). The data focuses on a number of characteristics of 104 conflicts that took place in this period: political level of the conflict, the factions engaged in it, alliances, polarization of the international system, balance, duration of the conflict etc. The data, together with the codebook which explains the variable coding, can be retrieved from the following address: <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/02016">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/02016</a>.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Each of the days has an associated syntax file (with a ".R" extension). The file contains all instructions for installing needed R packages, reading data and producing statistical output. In addition to these, the file will contain comment on the code, which will appear after a hashtag symbol ("#"). The only thing participants will need to do is replace the working directory in the file to the folder address on their computer, and make sure that the folder structure is the same as mine. That will ensure that no further changes need to be made to the code to make it run on another machine, regardless of whether it is a UNIX or Windows-based system.</p>

<p>With regard to the folder structure, my practice has been to create a different folder for each day, e.g. "/Day-1/". In this folder I usually create 4 sub-folders: <b>Code</b> ("/Day-1/Code/"), <b>Data</b>, <b>Graphs</b>, and <b>Output</b>. The first two are where the syntax file and the data are deposited, while the last two are where graphs and statistical output (tables) are exported. Every syntax file below assumes that these same folders exist on your computer as well.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>Please download the materials found below, arranged based on session. The syntax and unpacked data files should be placed in their respective folders on your machine.</p>

<p> <b>Day 1 (September 3)</b>
<p>We'll only focus on the "Bayesian" part of "Bayesian analysis", so it will be mostly theoretical. No data or code available for today.</p>
