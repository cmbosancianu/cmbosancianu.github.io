<h1>Event History Analysis with R</h1>
<p>The 2-day workshop is intended as a basic introduction to the logic of event history (survival, reliability)
analysis, and in the practice of running such an analysis in the R software. The first part of the workshop is
devoted to basic concepts in survival analysis, which have to be grasped in order to move on to advanced analyses.
These concepts refer to what a survival probability or a hazard rate is, what is a risk set, and how to use these
when describing our data. The first part concludes with a look at descriptive survival analysis: examining survival
and hazard functions for different groups in our data.

The second part of the workshop is fully devoted to inferential survival analysis. We examine here the Cox
proportional hazards (PH) model, as well as how do detect whether the PH assumption is met. Extensions of the Cox
PH model are also discussed: the stratified Cox model, as well as how to include time-variant observations in our
models. All analyses will be done with the help of the <tt>survival</tt> package in R.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>We will be relying on multiple data sources throughout the workshop. This is because in some cases I needed to 
highlight certain statistical properties of the models (e.g. the PH assumption) and this could be done only for
a particular data set. I have tried, in any case, to keep the number of data sources to a minimum.</p>

<p>In the first day, we will look at data on sovereign debt defaults for a number of countries around the world,
between 1980 and 2000. The data comes from Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff 
[<a href="http://www.carmenreinhart.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7/">URL</a>] and covers the 1800-2007 period.
For the purposes of my analysis, I considerably restricted the period, and focused only on sovereign debt crises.</p>

<p>On the second day, I rely on three medical data sets, of which the first two are used in Hosmer, Jr. and Lemeshow (1999). 
The first data source, called <tt>hmohiv</tt> tracks 100 patients from a US HMO who are infected with HIV, up to the 
point of their death, or loss to study (hypothetical data). Information is available about their age upon entering 
the study, as well as their prior drug use. The data is available here 
[<a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/examples/asa/hmohiv.csv">CSV</a>].</p>

<p>The second data source, called <tt>uissurv</tt>, tracks 628 individuals who participated in a randomized trial for
residential treatment for drug use. The trial took place at two locations (A and B) over varying periods of time
(3, 6, or 12 months). The treatment consisted of either health education and information on how to avoid relapsing
into drug use, or therapy in a communal living setting which was highly structured. Individuals with drug addiction
problems were enrolled in the study and tracked until they relapsed into drug use again. The data is available here
[<a href="https://www.umass.edu/statdata/statdata/data/uissurv.dat">DAT</a>] and was extensively used in published
work (e.g. McCusker et al. 1995).</p>

<p>The third source is available in the <tt>survival</tt> package, called <tt>heart</tt>. It contains observations on
103 individuals which were part of the Stanford Heart Transplant Study (1967-1974). The study tracks these individuals,
only some of which have received a heart transplant, until they die. Information is available on their age, the year
they have joined the study, and whether they had previously undergone bypass surgery.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Each of the days has an associated syntax file (with a ".R" extension). The file contains all instructions for 
installing needed R packages, reading data and producing statistical output. In addition to these, the file will 
contain comment on the code, which will appear after a hashtag symbol ("#"). The only thing participants will need 
to do is replace the working directory in the file to the folder address on their computer, and make sure that the 
folder structure is the same as mine. That will ensure that no further changes need to be made to the code to make 
it run on another machine, regardless of whether it is a UNIX or Windows-based system.</p>

<p>With regard to the folder structure, my practice has been to create a different folder for each day, e.g. 
"/Day-1/". In this folder I usually create 4 sub-folders: <b>Code</b> ("/Day-1/Code/"), <b>Data</b>, <b>Graphs</b>, 
and <b>Output</b>. The first two are where the syntax file and the data are deposited, while the last two are where 
graphs and statistical output (tables) are exported. Every syntax file below assumes that these same folders exist 
on your computer as well.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>Please download the materials found below, arranged based on session. The syntax and unpacked data files should 
be placed in their respective folders on your machine.</p>

<p> <b>Day 1 (November 2)</b>
<p>We focus today on basic theoretical concepts in survival analysis, and how to do descriptive summaries of
survival data in R.</p>
