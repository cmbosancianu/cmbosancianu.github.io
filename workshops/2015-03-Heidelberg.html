<h1>Applied Regression with R</h1>
<p>The 5-day workshop is intended as an introductory-level session for people who have never had contact with the R statistical environment. As such, it aims to get participants at a level where they understand the basic functionality of R, can use the software for all the basic operations involved in a standard OLS regression, and have the foundations required to go beyond this level.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data used in each session comes from the <a href="http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/">European Social Survey</a>. For the first day, I have created a trimmed down version of the data: only a subset of variables, and a random subset of cases. Even so, this format is sufficient for what we intend to do: recode, examine data, read different data formats. For the following days the datasets are aggregate, country-level measures obtained with the full data. Each of the data sets used is listed under its respective day.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Each of the days has an associated syntax file (with a ".R" extension). The file contains all instructions for installing needed R packages, reading data and producing statistical output. In addition to these, the file will contain comment on the code, which will appear after a hashtag symbol ("#"). The only thing participants will need to do is replace the working directory in the file to the folder address on their computer, and make sure that the folder structure is the same as mine. That will ensure that no further changes need to be made to the code to make it run on another machine, regardless of whether it is a UNIX or Windows-based system.</p>

<p>With regard to the folder structure, my practice has been to create a different folder for each day, e.g. "/Day-1/". In this folder I usually create 4 sub-folders: <b>Code</b> ("/Day-1/Code/"), <b>Data</b>, <b>Graphs</b>, and <b>Output</b>. The first two are where the syntax file and the data are deposited, while the last two are where graphs and statistical output (tables) are exported. Every syntax file below assumes that these same folders exist on your computer as well.</p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
Please download the materials found below, arranged based on session. The syntax and unpacked data files should be placed in their respective folders on your machine.

<p>
You will be able to get <tt>Zelig</tt> model vignettes (small tutorials) from <a href="http://perso.md2t.eu/al/M2FEA/UE1%20-%20MODELISATION%20SIG%20ET%20BASE/Stats/i486-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.11/Zelig/doc/">this</a> web address. Although they belong to an older version of <tt>Zelig</tt>, they should be still helpful in the beginning. Please note that sometime this summer <tt>Zelig</tt> will undergo a large update, as it moves from version 4 to version 5. Although the syntax I have shown you will continue to work for a while, you will gradually have to move to the new syntax (which won't be very different from the old one, I promise).
