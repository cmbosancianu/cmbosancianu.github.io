<h1>Introductory Time Series Analysis with R/Stata</h1>
<p>Materials for a three-day intensive workshop on introductory time-series analysis. The sessions were organized by Prof. Daniela &#352;irini&cacute; and held at the Faculty of Political Science, Zagreb University. A copy of the schedule and reading list can be found here [<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Al8uhOduiqFPg7I2jBnLOsC0vEzebg">PDF</a>]. <a href="http://zfazekas.github.io/">Zolt&aacute;n Fazekas</a> and <a href="http://federicovegetti.github.io/">Federico Vegetti</a> were co-instructors. They handled the first two parts of the workshop and were tremendously helpful with software troubleshooting during the sessions I taught.</p>

<p>Slides, code files in Stata and R, as well as data sets are listed under each session. R code was produced by myself, while Federico generated most of the Stata code. I am indebted to him for the considerable help he volunteered.</p>

<p>The main data for the time-series component of the workshop comes from the <a href="http://www.comparativeagendas.info/">Comparative Agendas Project</a>, focusing only on the series for the United Kingdom. Smaller data sets used throughout comes from the <i>MARPOR</i> project, or was simulated by myself.</p>

        <h3>Session 1</h3>
        <p>We covered basic terms from time-series analysis: stationarity, auto-correlation, moving average and auto-regressive processes. We also looked at the ACF and PACF, as tools of diagnosing the type of processes we are observing.</p>
        <p> 
        <ul>
          <li>Slides [<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Al8uhOduiqFPg7I6xvdf3eDc-6OoSA">PDF</a>]</li>
          <li>R syntax [available upon request]</li>

          <li>Miscellaneous data [available upon request]</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Session 2</h3>
        <p>We trained more on spotting AR and MA trends in data, as well as a few tests for stationarity in data.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slides [<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Al8uhOduiqFPg7I4tD9D5I1csi_Eww">PDF</a>]</li>

          <li>Miscellaneous data [available upon request]</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Session 3</h3>
        <p>We learn how to estimate very simple AR and MA processes, and finish up with a composite ARMA process. The data is the UK series used in the first session, as well as a smaller series with exchange rates between New Zealand and UK. An additional data set, used for the ARMA model, is available below as a <tt>.CSV</tt> file.</p>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Session 4</h3>
        <p>In this session we cover non-stationary processes and ARIMA models. Part of the data comes from the <i>MARPOR</i> project.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slides [<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Al8uhOduiqFPg7I7zkMhRKck0VRvlA">PDF</a>]</li>

          <li>CMP data [available upon request]</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Session 5</h3>
        <p>In this session we cover auto-regressive distributed lag (ADL) models and special cases of these very general specifications. We finish off with vector auto-regressive specifications (VAR). The data used is still the UK series from the CAP.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Slides [<a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Al8uhOduiqFPg7I8aGeIbZgC52uI0g">PDF</a>]</li>

          <li>Stata syntax [available upon request]</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Session 6</h3>
        <p>In the final session we see an example of an error correction model (ECM), which is rapidly becoming a very popular specification in political science.</p>
