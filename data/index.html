<p>As part of some of the projects I have been involved in, I have assembled a few data sets which are made available here free to download and use provided that they are properly attributed. If, in certain instances, I am not allowed to post the raw data due to copyright issues, the "data set" might represent R code for merging the raw data which then needs to be obtained by the user.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tov.html">"True OECD Voter"</a> - the data set extends the "True European Voter" (TEV) project to cover a number of OECD countries (United States, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Israel, plus a full series for the United Kingdom). <tt>[updated June 5, 2017]</tt> As the TEV project has not been launched yet, the R scripts that perform the merging will be uploaded at a later date.</li>
</ul>
