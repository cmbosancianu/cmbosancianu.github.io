<li>The <tt>lme4</tt> package for R, with its accompanying <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf">manual</a>. The package is now actively maintained by Ben Bolker.</li>

<li>The <tt>nlme</tt> package for R, with its accompanying <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/nlme.pdf">manual</a> - also allows for non-linear models. Created by Jos√© Pinheiro and Douglas Bates, but now actively maintained by the R-Core team.</li>

<li>Jeroen C. L. Ooms' web-based <a href="http://rweb.stat.ucla.edu/lme4/">interface</a> for <tt>lme4</tt>, hosted by the UCLA servers, which allows for good demo functionality for the package. Jeroen also makes available a similar <a href="http://rweb.stat.ucla.edu/ggplot2/">interface</a> for the <tt>ggplot2</tt> package, which is also good fun for creating graphs.</li>

<li>The Centre for Multilevel Modeling at Bristol also maintains <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/software/mlwin/">MLwiN</a>, another great software for running mixed-effects models - free for UK academics and UK-based students; teaching version is free, paid otherwise, but with a trial license that lasts for 30 days.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.ssicentral.com/hlm/">HLM</a>, available only for Windows unfortunately, but also capable of handling non-linear mixed-effects models.</li>

<li>Still the standard in terms of ease of learning the syntax for a variety of multilevel models and structural equation models is <a href="https://www.statmodel.com/">MPlus</a> - a demo version is available for free. To my knowledge, the only software which can run a three-level multilevel structural equation model with a dichotomous dependent variable (if one is in need of that). Paras Mehta's <a href="http://xxm.times.uh.edu/">xxM</a> also promises to have this ability, although I haven't given it a try myself... yet.</li>

</ol>

<p>SPSS and Stata are natural options as well - the only reason why they haven't been covered in this list is because they're so well known. Stata's <tt>xtmixed</tt> command does the job beautifully, and SPSS's capabilities in multilevel modeling have increased considerably since being taken over by IBM.</p>
