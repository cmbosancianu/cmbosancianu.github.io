<li>A <a href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/papers/mlmpapers.htm">collection</a> on papers for multilevel modeling is maintained by the IDRE at UCLA.</li>

<li>The Centre for Multilevel Modeling at Bristol University. A great <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/">site</a> for finding tutorials, papers, or software.</li>

<li>A gentle <a href="http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/6469/1/RR791.pdf">introduction</a> into the topic of cross-classified and multiple membership models is to be found in Antony Fielding and Harvey Goldstein, 2006, "Cross-classified and Multiple Membership Structures in Multilevel Models: An Introduction and Review", Research report no. 791, Department of Education and Skills, Institute of Education, University of London.</li>

<li>A very good <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/met/12/2/121/">article</a> on centering predictors in multilevel models: Craig K. Enders and Davood Tofighi, 2007, "Centering predictor variables in cross-sectional multilevel models: a new look at an old issue", <i>Psychological Methods</i> <b>12</b>(2): 121-138.</li>

<li>A good article (<a href="http://www.daniel-stegmueller.com/files/Stegmueller_AJPS2013.pdf">preprint</a>) for sample size considerations in multilevel models: Daniel Stegm√ºller, 2013, "How Many Countries for Multilevel Modeling?A Comparison of Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches", <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <b>57</b>(3): 748-761. The fact that ML estimation doesn't yield reliable estimates for small sample sizes at the level-2 is not new information; what is more valuable is the precise threshold under which a Bayesian approach leads to better estimates.</li>

<li>It can be the case in analyzing TSCS data that a relationship between DV and IV is valid only cross-sectionally and not longitudinally as well. This point is why I think Malcolm Fairbrother, 2013, "Two Multilevel Modeling Techniques for Analyzing Comparative Longitudinal Survey Datasets", <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, <b>2</b>(1): 119-140, is a very good piece (<a href="http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~ggmhf/MHF.Longit2013.AM.pdf">preprint</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>There are probably more topics which can be covered here, such as the use of weights in multilevel models (e.g. Tihomir Asparouhov, 2006, "General Multi-Level Modeling with Sampling Weights", <i>Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods</i>, <b>35</b>(3): 439-460, (<a href="https://www.statmodel.com/download/asparouhovgmms.pdf">preprint</a>). Unfortunately, they tend to be heavily technical pieces, sometimes quite confusing for someone without a mathematical background such as myself.</p>
