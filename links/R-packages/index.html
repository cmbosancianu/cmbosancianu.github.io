<p>A list of R packages I constantly use in my statistical analyses:</p>

<ol>

<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/texreg/texreg.pdf">texreg</a>: for exporting output from a variety of statistical models into comparison tables, both in LaTeX and HTML. It saves vast amounts of time in terms of copy/pasting output into tables in working papers. Alternatives are <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/stargazer.pdf">stargazer</a> (also very flexible), and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apsrtable/apsrtable.pdf">apsrtable</a> (notable for the possibility to export longtables in LaTeX, which are frequently necessary when running multilevel models).</li>

<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/knitr.pdf">knitr</a>: generating dynamic reports in R. Fantastic tool, able to export both LaTeX and HTML documents. Simplifies paper writing by doing away with the need to keep script and paper separate. The paper is simply written with code chunks in between paragraphs, which produce tables, graphs, coefficients etc. to be displayed in the paper. The author of the package, Yihui Xie, maintains a <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">webpage</a> with good resources for all the package options. The book which accompanies the package, "Dynamic Documents with R and knitr" is also available [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1482203537/ref=cm_sw_su_dp">Amazon</a>].</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Karl Broman offers a basic <a href="http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/">introduction</a> into reproducible research.</li>
      <li>For those of you with patience to sift through the huge collection of materials posted by Jeff Leek, Roger Peng, Brian Caffo, Nick Carchedi and Sean Kross, this <a href="https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses">webpage</a> is a treasure trove.</li>
    </ul>

<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/plyr.pdf">plyr</a>: the Swiss-army knife of applying the same functions to smaller chunks of data in data frames, lists or arrays, and then aggregating the information. Much faster than <tt>for()</tt> loops in R, and one of the few packages that is worth the effort of mastering, as it can be used over and over again in all sorts of data preparation tasks.</li>

<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf">ggplot2</a>: hi-res statistical graphs, using Leland Wilkinson's <i>grammar of graphics</i> principles. Created by Hadley Wickham, who also authored and maintains <tt>plyr</tt>, it's my go-to package for 99% of the graphs I end up producing and including in papers. Hadley also maintains an extensive <a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/">website</a> with <tt>ggplot2</tt> graphs and code, which provide a very good tutorial for getting started with the package.</li>

<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf">lme4</a>: linear mixed-effects modeling in R. It can handle both continuous data, through the <tt>lmer()</tt> command, as well as discrete data, through the <tt>glmer()</tt> command. Previously maintained by <a href="http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/">Douglas Bates</a>, currently by <a href="http://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/">Ben Bolker</a>. I use it continuously for multilevel modeling.</li>

<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html">stringr</a>: a variety of functions for handling strings in R. I constantly have to rely on it when cleaning up data, for extracting particular sets of characters (e.g. years), merging and splitting strings, or tidying up text (e.g. white space at the end or beginning of country names).</li>
