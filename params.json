{"name":"Manuel Bosancianu","tagline":"Papers, projects, political science","body":"### About myself\r\nI'm a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Central European University](http://www.ceu.hu), Budapest. In my work I focus on the effects of income inequality at the aggregate level on individual-level political attitudes and behaviors, and how this further impacts party dynamics in advanced industrial democracies. I frequently rely on R, LaTeX and Emacs for my work, and on coffee to get me through the headaches caused by the first three.\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by!\r\nManuel","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
